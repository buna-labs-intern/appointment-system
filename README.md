# NexaCare — Clinic Appointment Management System

A full-stack, enterprise-grade web application built for clinics to manage doctors, patients, services, and appointment scheduling with role-based access control and strict business rule enforcement.

## 🏥 Project Overview

The **Clinic Appointment Management System (NexaCare)** is designed to streamline daily clinic operations by providing structured, role-based workflows for Administrators and Receptionists:

- **Administrators**: Manage the overall system, create and activate/deactivate receptionist accounts, manage doctors and services, view analytics dashboards and operational reports.
- **Receptionists**: Handle daily front-desk workflows including patient registration, searching patient records, scheduling appointments, checking in patients, and completing visits.
- **Doctors**: Are treated as medical resources allocated to appointments (do not log into the system).

## ⚙️ Key Features & Business Rules

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Secure JWT-based login with hashed password comparison.
- Role-Based Access Control (`ADMIN` vs `RECEPTIONIST`).

### 2. Clinic Operating Hours & Lunch Break Enforcement
- **Morning Session:** `09:00 AM – 12:00 PM`
- **Lunch Break:** `12:00 PM – 01:00 PM` *(strictly prevents scheduling appointments during or spanning across lunch)*
- **Afternoon Session:** `01:00 PM – 05:00 PM`

### 3. Appointment Booking Rules
- **Valid Time Range:** End time must always be later than start time (`endTime > startTime`).
- **No Past Appointments:** Start time cannot be in the past.
- **Doctor Conflict Prevention:** Prevents overlapping appointments for the same doctor.
- **Doctor & Service Status:** Inactive doctors and inactive services cannot receive new bookings.
- **Completed Appointments:** Once marked as `COMPLETED`, appointments become read-only.
- **Cancelled Appointments:** Automatically releases the doctor's time slot for new bookings.

### 4. Appointment Status Lifecycle
```text
SCHEDULED ──▶ CHECKED_IN ──▶ COMPLETED
    │
    ├──▶ CANCELLED (Slot freed)
    └──▶ NO_SHOW
```

## 🗄️ Database Setup & Seeding

The PostgreSQL database is structured with normalized relational entities:
- **`User`**: Administrator and Receptionist accounts with `role` and `isActive` status.
- **`Doctor`**: Medical staff with `specialty`, `phone`, and `isActive` status.
- **`Patient`**: Patients with `phone`, `gender`, `birthDate`, `address`, and `notes`.
- **`Service`**: Clinic services with `name`, `description`, `price`, `duration`, and `isActive` status.
- **`Appointment`**: Appointments linking patient, doctor, service, time slot, and lifecycle status.

### Seeders

Two idempotent scripts — re-running never duplicates rows:

| Command | Script | What it seeds |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `npm run prisma:seed` | `Backend/prisma/seed.ts` | Base data: initial clinic (**NexaCare** tenant + **Main Branch**, wired as the tenant's default branch), platform super admin, clinic users, services, doctors, patients |
| `npm run seed:demo` | `seed.ts` **+** `Backend/prisma/demo-data.ts` | Base data **plus** demo appointments (today / upcoming / completed / cancelled), receptionist staff shifts, notifications, and a second clinic (**Hargeisa Medical Center**) with its own owner |

```bash
cd Backend
npm run prisma:seed   # base data only
npm run seed:demo     # base data + demo data (recommended for local testing)
```

Clinics created through the API while testing can be wiped with:
```bash
cd Backend
npx ts-node prisma/cleanup-test-tenants.ts
```

#### Seeded Data Details

**Base seed (`prisma/seed.ts`):**
- Tenant `NexaCare` (slug `nexacare`) + Branch `Main Branch` (slug `main-branch`) as the tenant's default branch.
- 5 services: General Consultation, Follow-up Consultation, Pediatrics Consultation, Medical Certificate, Blood Pressure Check.
- 3 doctors: Dr. Sara Ahmed, Dr. Mohamed Ali, Dr. Amina Yusuf *(inactive — useful for testing filters).*
- 3 patients: Hassan Omar, Fadumo Abdi, Yusuf Ismail.

**Demo seed (`prisma/demo-data.ts`, requires the base seed):**
- 8 appointments for NexaCare: 3 today, 1 tomorrow, 3 completed in past days, 1 cancelled — so the dashboard is populated.
- 2 staff shifts for the receptionist (today + tomorrow).
- 3 notifications.
- Second clinic `Hargeisa Medical Center` (own branch, doctor, service) with owner `owner@hmc.com`, seeded with the *must-change-password* flag set so the first-login flow can be tested.

#### Default Credentials:
- **Platform Super Admin** *(admin dashboard, `admin-frontend/`)*:
  - **Email:** `super@nexacare.com`
  - **Password:** `Super@12345`
- **Administrator** *(NexaCare clinic)*:
  - **Email:** `admin@hospital.com`
  - **Password:** `Admin@12345`
- **Receptionist:**
  - **Email:** `receptionist@hospital.com`
  - **Password:** `Reception@12345`
- **Clinic Owner** *(Hargeisa Medical Center, demo-data seed only — forced password change on first login)*:
  - **Email:** `owner@hmc.com`
  - **Password:** `Owner@12345`

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### 1. Prepare Backend Database
From the `Backend` directory:
```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npm run prisma:generate

# Push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Seed base data (initial clinic, super admin, admin, receptionist, doctors, services, patients)
npm run prisma:seed

# Or seed base + demo data (appointments, shifts, notifications, second clinic) for local testing
npm run seed:demo
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server
```bash
# From Backend/ directory:
npm run dev

## 🧪 Automated Testing

The backend includes an automated test suite verifying business rules, operating hours, lunch restrictions, conflict detection, password hashing, and appointment lifecycles:

```bash
cd Backend
npm test
```

### Production Build Validation
To verify TypeScript compilation and build production bundles:
```bash
# Test backend build
cd Backend
